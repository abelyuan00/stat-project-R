## DSCI 6659 Project Report 

## 1. Introduction

  In this project, our objective is to analyze car sales data using methods covered in our class, focusing on data analysis and machine learning techniques. We aim to predict a target of our interests based on various explanatory variables present in the data set obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report).

The data set includes 23,906 observations over two years, from 2022 to 2023, and includes 16 variables related to car sales transactions.

Our analysis will focus on key aspects following:

1. Customers' Perspective: We will explore how customer income correlates with car sales, identify favorite car companies among customers, and analyze the impact of gender on car sales.  

2. Dealers' Perspective: We will examine regional variations in car sales performance to provide insights for dealers about what to expect for the upcoming year.  

3. Machine Learning Applications: Using machine learning techniques, we will identify the key factors influencing car prices and sales, contributing to a better understanding of market trends. By addressing these questions, we aim to provide insights into the car sales market.
