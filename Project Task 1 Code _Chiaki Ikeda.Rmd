## 1. Introduction

  In this project, our objective is to analyze car sales data using methods covered in our class, focusing on data analysis and machine learning techniques. We aim to predict a target of our interests based on various explanatory variables present in the data set obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report).

The data set includes 23,906 observations over two years, from 2022 to 2023, and includes 16 variables related to car sales transactions.

Our analysis will focus on key aspects following:

1. Customers' Perspective: We will explore how customer income correlates with car sales, identify favorite car companies among customers, and analyze the impact of gender on car sales.  

2. Dealers' Perspective: We will examine regional variations in car sales performance to provide insights for dealers about what to expect for the upcoming year.  

3. Machine Learning Applications: Using machine learning techniques, we will identify the key factors influencing car prices and sales, contributing to a better understanding of market trends. By addressing these questions, we aim to provide insights into the car sales market.

## 2. Data Analysis - Task 1 

### 2-1. Data Overview (before data cleaning)

In this data set, 23906 observations with 16 variables are included.There is no missing values detected. Except for "Annual.Income", "Dealer_No", and "Price", the rest of variables are character. 

For data analysis, we do not use identification information, such as "Car_id", "Customer.Name", "Dealer_Name","Dealer_No", and "Phone".


```{r, echo=FALSE}
names(df_car)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
str(df_car)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(df_car)
```


### 2-2. Interpretation of each variable and data preprocessing 

We selected variables that are our interests, keeping car_id for the data integration.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_car_selected <- data.frame(df_car[, -c(3, 6, 13, 15)])
summary(df_car_selected)

#write.csv(df_car_selected, "car_sales_selected_variables.csv")
```

In the selected data, now we have 12 variables including "Car_id", which refers to unique identifier for each car in the data set. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
names(df_car_selected)
```

#### V2: "Date" - Date of car sales transaction

This data starts from January 2, 2022 to December 31, 2023, which is the daily car sale transaction over two years. Each bar represents the number of car sales in the month. As shown in the histogram below, car sales transaction increases in September, November, and December both in 2022 and 2023. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_car_selected1 <- df_car_selected
df_car_selected1$Date <- as.Date(df_car_selected1$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

summary(df_car_selected1$Date)

hist(df_car_selected1$Date, breaks = "months", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Transaction Frequency (%)", main = "Monthly Car Sales", col = 'blue')

ggplot(df_car_selected1, aes(x = Date)) + geom_histogram(bins = 24, fill = "steelblue3") + labs(x = "Date", y = "Transaction Frequency (%)", title = "Monthly Car Sales") +
  theme_minimal()

ggsave(file = "Monthly Car Sales.jpeg", plot = last_plot(), device = jpeg, width = 250, height = 100, units = 'mm')
```


#### V3: "Gender" - Gender of the customer, either Male or Female

Gender is a categorical variable including two classes, "Male" and "Female". In this data set, male customers account for 79% (21% for females) of total car sales transactions. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_car_selected1$Gender <- as.factor(df_car_selected1$Gender)
unique(df_car_selected1$Gender)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(df_car_selected1$Gender)

male_per <- 18798/23906*100

```


#### V4: "Annual.Income" - Annual Income of Customers ($)


The annual income of customers are in the range from 10.1 k to 11.2 million dollars. Overall, the distribution is right-skewed, suggesting that more observations fall in lower incomes. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(df_car_selected1$Annual.Income)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


#### V7: "Engine" - Specifications of the Car Engine

Variable "Engine" is also a categorical variable including 2 classes, either DoubleÃƒ Overhead Camshaft or Overhead Camshaft. In this modified data set, we call them "Double A" and "Overhead Camshaft". Among two types of engines, Double A is slightly more popular than the other one. The percentages of Double A and Camshaft are 53% and 47%, respectively.   


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#df_car_selected1$Engine
df_car_selected1$Engine[df_car_selected1$Engine != "Overhead Camshaft"] <- "Double A"

df_car_selected1$Engine <- as.factor(df_car_selected1$Engine)

        xlab = "Engine", ylab = "Count", ylim = c(0, 15000), col = c("green3", "purple"), 
        legend.text = TRUE)

```


#### V8: "Transmission" - Type of Transmission in the Car

Variable "Transmission" has a class of two type of transmission of the car in the data set, either Auto or Manual. Overall, Automatic cars are purchased more than Manual cars, accounting for 53% of the total transaction, while the rest of 47% is manual transmission cars. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
unique(df_car_selected1$Transmission)

        xlab = "Color", ylab = "Count", col = c("grey1", "ivory", "red2"), legend.text = TRUE)

#jpeg(file = "Car Sales Transcation by Color.jpeg", width = 100, height = 100, units = "mm", res =300)

#barplot(table(df_car_selected1$Color),  main = "Car Sales Transcation by Color", 
       # xlab = "Color", ylab = "Count", col = c("grey1", "ivory", "red2"), legend.text = TRUE)

#dev.off()
```


#### V10: "Price" - Listed Sales Price of the Car

The price of the car is in the range from 1.2k to 85.8 k dollars. The distribution is right-skewed, which is similar to that of the annual income of customers. The median is 23k and the mean price is 28 k. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(df_car_selected1$Price)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2,1))

Among these five classes, SUV and Hatchback are two top styles accounting for 27% and 26%, respectively. Passenger cars are the least popular, which are 17% of the total transaction. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
unique(df_car_selected1$Body.Style)
df_car_selected1$Body.Style <- as.factor(df_car_selected1$Body.Style)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


#### V12: "Dealer_Region" - Geographic Region of the Car Dealer 

The region includes seven areas including Middletown, Aurora, Greenville, Pasco, Janeville, Scottsdale, and Austin. The most common region is Austin accounting for 17%, followed by Janesville (16%) and the rest of regional rates are in the range from 13-14%. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
unique(df_car_selected1$Dealer_Region)
df_car_selected1$Dealer_Region <- as.factor(df_car_selected1$Dealer_Region)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Counts
summary(df_car_selected1$Dealer_Region)

# Percentage
summary(df_car_selected1$Dealer_Region) / 23906*100
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
region_counts <- table(factor(df_car_selected1$Dealer_Region))
sorted_region <- names(sort(region_counts, decreasing = TRUE))
ordered_region <- factor(df_car_selected1$Dealer_Region, levels = sorted_region)
barplot(table(ordered_region), ylim = c(0, 4500), main = "Car Sales Transaction by Dealer Region", ylab = "Count", las = 2, cex.axis = 0.8)
```

#### Summary

After the transformation of data type, the summary of the new data set is as shown below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(df_car_selected1)
```

To sum up, cars are sold the most in September, November, and December by mostly male customers. 
Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford are well-selling brands, and customers prefer SUV or Hatchback, with pale white color. Diamante by Mitsubishi, Prizm by Chevrolet and Silhouette by Oldsmobile are the most popular models. There is no huge difference between transmission types and engine types. The car price and customer's annual income showed similar trends, with the right-skewed distributions. Car dealers are most commonly located in Austin and Janeville in this data set, that may be associated with the income distribution as customers in this region are richer than others to afford to purchase a car.   



### 2-3. Relationship between variables in the data set


First, we check whether customer's income is associated with annual income. As shown below, high income customers do not necessarily purchase expensive cars.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df_car_selected1, aes(x = Annual.Income, y = Price, color = Price)) +
  geom_point() + labs(x = "Annual Income", y = "Car Price", color = "Price") +
  ggtitle("Customer's Income vs. Car Price")

#ggsave(file = "income vs price.jpeg", plot = last_plot(), device = jpeg)
```


Next, we check the relationship between dealer region and customers' annual income. As we expected, Austin, the most common locations of dealers, has a slightly higher income distribution. However, the second common region, Janesville has a similar distribution to others. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df_car_selected1, aes(x = Annual.Income, y = Dealer_Region, color = Annual.Income)) +
  geom_point() + labs(x = "Annual Income", y = "Region", color = "Annual Income") +
  ggtitle("Annual Income vs. Region")

ggplot(df_car_selected1, aes(x = Dealer_Region, y = Annual.Income, fill = Dealer_Region)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Region", y = "Annual Income", fill = "Region") +
  ggtitle("Annual Income Distribution by Region")
```

Furthermore, we check whether the well-selling color is cheaper than other colors. Overall, we can see Black is the most expensive and pale white is the least expensive color. Hence, this supports the assumption that customers prefer the color due to the lower price. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df_car_selected1, aes(x = Color, y = Price, fill = Color)) +
  geom_boxplot() + labs(x = "Color", y = "Car Price", fill = "Color") +
  ggtitle("Color vs. Car Price")
```

We also try to check whether car sales increases when the price becomes cheaper or customer's income becomes higher. Blue lines indicates months with higher car sales. As shown below, the car price does not seems to be associated with the months people purchased car the most. However, the income tends to be higher in summer, before the season of higher car sales. Hence, customer's income may be associated with car purchasing behavior. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_car_with_dummy <- df_car_selected1
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_car_selected1$Month <- format(df_car_selected1$Date, "%Y-%m")
mean_price_by_month <- tapply(df_car_selected1$Price, df_car_selected1$Month, mean)

plot(mean_price_by_month, type = "o", 
     xlab = "Month", ylab = "Mean Price",
     main = "Mean Price by Month") 
abline(v = c(9, 11, 12, 21, 23, 24), col = "blue", lty = 2)



df_car_selected1$Month <- format(df_car_selected1$Date, "%Y-%m")
mean_income_by_month <- tapply(df_car_selected1$Annual.Income, df_car_selected1$Month, mean)

plot(mean_income_by_month, type = "o", 
     xlab = "Month", ylab = "Mean Annual Income",
     main = "Mean Annual Income by Month")
abline(v = c(9, 11, 12, 21, 23, 24), col = "blue", lty = 2)

#jpeg(file = "Mean_Annual_Income_by_Month.jpeg", width = 250, height = 100, units = "mm", res =300)

#plot(mean_income_by_month, type = "o", 
#     xlab = "Month", ylab = "Mean Annual Income",
#     main = "Mean Annual Income by Month")
#abline(v = c(9, 11, 12, 21, 23, 24), col = "blue", lty = 2)

#dev.off()
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#head(df_car_with_dummy)

# Gender: Male = 1, Female = 0
df_car_with_dummy$Gender <- ifelse(df_car_with_dummy$Gender == "Male", 1, 0)

# Engine:  Double A = 1, Shamcraft Overhead = 0
df_car_with_dummy$Engine <- ifelse(df_car_with_dummy$Engine == "Double A", 1, 0)

# Transmission:  Auto = 1, Manual = 0
df_car_with_dummy$Transmission <- ifelse(df_car_with_dummy$Transmission == "Auto", 1, 0)

# Create dummy columns for the rest of categorical variables
car_dummy_cols <- dummy_cols(df_car_with_dummy, select_columns = c("Company", "Model", "Color", "Body.Style", "Dealer_Region" ))

# Create binary data
df_car_binary <- cbind(df_car_with_dummy[, 1:4], df_car_with_dummy[, 7:8], 'Price' = df_car_with_dummy[, 10], car_dummy_cols[, -(1:12)])
#write.csv(df_car_binary, "car_sales_binary_dummy.csv")

#head(df_car_binary[1:37])

#head(df_car_binary[192:206])

```

For correlation analysis, all variables used to check relationships were converted into binary. Between Price and other variables, we can clearly see Cadillac is positively associated with Price, and Hyndai is negatively associated with Price. Also, Engine type Double A is highly correlated with Auto transmission. 

```{r}
# Removing "Model" and "Dealer_Region"
df_cor <- cbind(df_car_binary[, 3:37], df_car_binary[, 192:199])
df_cor <- cbind('Price' = df_cor$Price, df_cor[, -5])
head(df_cor)

correlation_matrix <- cor(df_cor)  
heatmap(correlation_matrix)
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", tl.cex = 0.7)

#jpeg(file = "correlation_matrix.jpeg", width = 200, height = 200, units = "mm", res =300)
#corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", tl.cex = 0.7)

#dev.off()
```


### 2-4. Robust PCA analysis

For PCA analysis, the data was modified to have a correct type and class, and then outlying observations were removed based on IQR.

Based on the robust PCA result, we can see Price and Model are highly correlated, and Company and Dealer_Region are also grouped in the same group, suggesting that they have similarity. In addition, abnormalities were detected based on this result, with a threshold of 3* sigma. After removing these observations, we tried fitting the robust PCA on the cleaned data.

Here, the result of robust PCA on cleaned data is shown. Although variations explained by the first and second principle components are not large, variables were clustered clearer than the uncleaned data. Now, Price, Model, and Company were in the same group, suggesting their positive correlations. This result indicates that the car price is likely to get influenced by car models and company, which is reasonable and consistent to the previous explanatory analysis result. Additionally, the result shows that annual income and color of the car is also associated, and dealer region and body styles also showed they are related to each other.

#### Summary

To sum up, we introduced the trends in the car sales data that the majority (78%) of customers are male, and the car price tends to be influenced by car model and brands (company). The popular brands are Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford, while popular models are Diamante (Mitsubishi), Prizm (Chevrolet), Silhouette (Oldsmobile), which is different from the brands ranking. Therefore, some specific models seem to attract customer's interests. In addition, SUV and Hatchback are two top selling style, with popular color, pale white. This preference can be explained by price of car by colors and the purpose of car purchasing as customers may prefer to have durable, long-lasting car, rather than appearance. The car sales were made mostly in Austin; however, there was not clear association between the region and other variables. Furthermore, associations between variables were also explained by the robust PCA result, showing that similar tendency with the findings previously explained, the car price seems to be determined by car model and brands rather than customer's income or regions. This result is interesting and useful for machine learning applications to predict the car sales price. Working on larger data with more variables associated with customers and car price may help assuming reasons and causes of these results we have seen in this project.
